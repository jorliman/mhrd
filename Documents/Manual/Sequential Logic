Sequential Logic
================

This chapter explains relevant aspects of sequential logic.

If you change the input values of a NAND gate, it doesn't change its output
values immediately, but instead it needs a short time to re-adjust. In
extension this is true for all hardware elements based on the NAND gate.

When doing the verification this is considered by using a clock. Each clock
cycle only one test is performed and the clock cycles are far apart enough, so
that the whole hardware element has time to stabilize its outputs.

What is apparent though is that each clock cycle and therefore test is
completely independent from the previous ones for non-sequential logic elements
(like the NAND gate).

The D-Flip-Flop or DEF element however has a memory. Its output value is the
input value of the last clock cycle. Therefore its outoput value is completely
independent on its input value for the current clock cycle and instead it
solely relies on its input value of the last clock cycle. This is what enables
the design of memory elements.

However it also means that a test con't be done in a single test step or clock
cycle anymore and instead you have to consider all test steps as a sequence.
Therefore you might find test steps expecting an output value of "x" which
simply means, that for that test step the output value is irrelevant.
