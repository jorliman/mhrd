// The interface spec of the NAND Gate:
Inputs: in1, in2;
Outputs: out;

// Now to build a NAND gate based on a NAND gate is kind
// of pointless in the bigger scheme of thingsm but here
// is how it would look like:
//
//       +----------+
//       |  ______  |
//  -in1-|-|      | |
//       | | NAND |-|--out-
//  -in2-|-|______| |
//       +----------+

// Now between the interface and the "Wires" section there
// is a "Parts" section where you need to specify which
// parts are used within your design
Parts:
  myNand NAND
;
// so the syntax here is:
// [id] [part_type]
// you can choose an id, but the part type has to be in
// the completed section of the designs
// like with wires, declare as many devices as you want to used

Wires:
  in1 -> myNand.in1, in2 -> myNand.in2,
  myNand.out -> out
;
// so you can connect the element's pins to the pins of the NAND
// make sure to reference the right part via its id, you declared

// again: CTRL+ENTER to check this design if you want
